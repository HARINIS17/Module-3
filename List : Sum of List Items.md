# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
def createlist(N):
    even_list=[i for i in range(12,N,2)]
    total=sum(even_list)
    print("List =", even_list)
    print("Sum of the list",total)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus the program executed successfully
