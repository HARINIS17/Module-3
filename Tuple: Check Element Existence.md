# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks a Python program to check whether an element  52 and 12 are there in the tuple

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `'52'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `12` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x=("12", 8, "21", "10", "11", "52", "u", "r", "c", "e")
print("52" in tuple )
print("12" in tuple)
```
## Output

## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.
